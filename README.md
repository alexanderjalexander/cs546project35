## Description:
BarterBuddy is a revolutionary trading platform targeted towards college students that allows people to trade items for other items. In other words, it is an attempt to forgo currency and bring back older practices of trading and bartering!
Whereas ecommerce and selling platforms like Ebay and Craigslist involve cash for items, students can post listings for individual items and trade one or more items with each other. It creates a fantastic way to not only get items you want faster, but also get rid of items quicker, all within your local college community!


## How to Use:

1. download and unzip (if needed) the code. (Make sure you have the env)
2. ensure all necessary development CLI’s are installed
3. in the root directory of the project run “npm install”
4. run “node ./tasks/seed.js”
5. then run “npm start”
